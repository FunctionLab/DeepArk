The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation.

Microglia clearly are capable of phagocytosis and play an important role in a wide spectrum of neuropathologies. They have also been suggested to act in several other roles including in secretion (e.g., of cytokines and neural growth factors), in immunological processing (e.g., antigen presentation), and in central nervous system development and remodeling.	64172989,97.6,50.5,31773	GSM2104282: Adult microglia k4me2; Mus musculus; ChIP-Seq	source_name=Adult microglia k4me2	strain=CX3CR1-GFP+ C57BL/6J	tissue=Brain	cell type=Adult microglia	chip antibody=K4me2 (Abcam, #ab32356)

Main types are PERITONEAL MACROPHAGES; ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES; HISTIOCYTES; KUPFFER CELLS of the liver; and OSTEOCLASTS. They may further differentiate within chronic inflammatory lesions to EPITHELIOID CELLS or may fuse to form FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELLS or LANGHANS GIANT CELLS.

Two types have been identified - cytotoxic (T-LYMPHOCYTES, CYTOTOXIC) and helper T-lymphocytes (T-LYMPHOCYTES, HELPER-INDUCER). They are formed when lymphocytes circulate through the THYMUS GLAND and differentiate to thymocytes. When exposed to an antigen, they divide rapidly and produce large numbers of new T cells sensitized to that antigen.	29290930,84.0,16.5,12804	GSM2641050: p65 IP in Tconv, anti-CD3/CD28 stim, rep2; Mus musculus; ChIP-Seq	source_name=Tconv + anti-CD3/CD28 stim	mouse strain=C57BL/6	tissues=Spleens+Lymph nodes	cell type=Conventional T cells	cell subtype=Tconv + anti-CD3/CD28 stim	chip antibody=anti-mouse p65 (Santa Cruz, sc-372, #K-0615)

Microglia clearly are capable of phagocytosis and play an important role in a wide spectrum of neuropathologies. They have also been suggested to act in several other roles including in secretion (e.g., of cytokines and neural growth factors), in immunological processing (e.g., antigen presentation), and in central nervous system development and remodeling.	128561066,85.6,23.7,6099	GSM2895880: ST H3K27me3 ChIP; Mus musculus; ChIP-Seq	source_name=Striatal microglia	strain background=C57BL/6	chip antibody=H3K27me3 (Millipore; 07-449)

Microglia vary in appearance depending on developmental stage, functional state, and anatomical location; subtype terms include ramified, perivascular, ameboid, resting, and activated. Microglia clearly are capable of phagocytosis and play an important role in a wide spectrum of neuropathologies. They have also been suggested to act in several other roles including in secretion (e.g., of cytokines and neural growth factors), in immunological processing (e.g., antigen presentation), and in central nervous system development and remodeling.	177410280,96.9,12.6,13301	GSM3175841: cxMg H3K27me3 ChIP; Mus musculus; ChIP-Seq	source_name=cxMg H3K27me3_ChIP	strain background=C57BL/6	age=4-8-month-old	genotype/variation=Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+	tissue=Cortical microglia	chip antibody=H3K27me3 (Millipore; 07-449)
